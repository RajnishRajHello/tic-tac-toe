- Started working on it on 29SEP2025.
- Made a simple version within 3 hrs.
- Will continue working on it as people suggests me.
- ------------THINGS TO WORK ON----------
  1.  Make it online Multiplayer.
  2.  (Reddit Suggestion) - try adding a single player mode in it, with minimax algo you can easily create an opponent, add a slight randomness and you'll get a beatable version of that algorithm, by default its pretty much unbeatable.
